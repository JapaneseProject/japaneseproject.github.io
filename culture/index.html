					<h1>Education</h1>
					<p>To the Japanese, the love of learning is an important virtue of a man's life.</p>
					<p>Eduation is a big part of Japanese culture.</p>
					<p>Education isn't focused on critical thinking, it's more focused on test taking.</p>
					<p>If parents find the schooling unsatisfactory, they can get a private tutor or send their kids to private schools.</p>
					<p>Formal education didn't come to Japan until the Chinese language system, which was adopted in 500 CE. Before then, only the rich could afford education.</p>

					<p>This is because of Tatemae, or the belief that there is a divide between one's public expression and their private opinions.</p>
					<p>They learn that their life is interdependant with others and they are taught a set of beliefs where fulfillment is gained through close association with others.</p>
