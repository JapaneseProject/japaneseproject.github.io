			<h1>Shikoku</h1>
			<p> Shikoku is a much smaller island compared to Honshu. It sits right underneath Honshu and is very mountainous. Unlike all other major islands, Shikoku does not have any volcanoes. Many forest are in Shikoku and many industries and companies have taken advantage of it. There are mild winters with temperatures much lower than Hokkaido, helping it to grow crops out of season as crops will survive in the winter there where in other places crops would die.</p>

			<h1>Influence</h1>
			<p> As Japan is a very mountainous country and rich in soil because of volcanic activity, agriculture is very popular. There is approximately 2 million farmers in the country. As it is also an archipelago, Japan is fully surrounded by water. As a result, the fishing industry is very big and japanese people’s diet consist of fish. Ultimately, Japan's geography influences the people's diets, jobs, and overall culture which includes things such as activities. </p>
