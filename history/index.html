					<h1>Government</h1>
					<p><b>The Emperor</b></p>
					<p>He is the head of the royal family, but has no real political power anymore. His role is now almost completely symbolic and relegated to ceremonial duties.</p>
					<p><b>Prime Minister</b><p>
					<p>The Prime Minister is the cheif executive of the Japanese government.</p>
					<p>He has the power to dissolve the House of Representatives whenever they want. They can also appoint and dismiss cabinet members.</p>
					<p><b>The Ministries</b></p>
					<p>There are eleven ministries exculding the cabinet, of which the minister is the Prime Minister</p>
					<p>Each Ministry handles its own seperate issue. For a full list of ministries, look at the 'More Information' Tab</p>
					<p><b>National Diet</b></p>
					<p>This is the legislative branch of Japan.</p>
					<p>The diet is a bicameral system (meaning they have two houses) with a lower house called the House of Representatives and an upper house called the House of Councillors.</p>
					<p>The Diet makes the laws, approves the conclusion of treaties, approves the selection of the Prime Minister, initiates the draft of constitutional amendments, etc.</p>
					<p><b>The Courts</b></p>
					<p>There are four courts in the Japanese Judiciary system. In order from lowest to highest, there is are the Summary Courts, the Family Courts, the District Courts, the High Courts, and the Supreme Court.</p>
					<p>It is written in the Constitution that no other branch may may have 'final judiciary power', as that power remains in the hands of the courts.</p>

					<h1>Migration</h1>
					<p>During the 8th Century CE, many Korean artists and intellectuals moved to Japan.</p>
					<p>During the 1600s, asylum was offered to a small number of Chinese families, who also came to Japan in droves.</p>
					<p>During World War II, there was a massive movement of forced immigration to Japan for Chinese and Korean workers.</p>
					<p>During the 1980s, many immigrants from all over the world came to Japan illegally, only being accepted so they could join Japan’s dwindling labour force.</p>
					<p>By 2009, immigration slowed to a relative crawl due to policies to make it more difficult for immigrants to get Visas.</p>

					<h1>Colonization</h1>
					<p>Most early colonization of Japan happened in the Southern part of the island now known as Honshu.</p>
					<p>It started, as most civilization does, with hunting and gathering, until someone made rice farms.</p>
					<p>After rice farms, people could grow rice quickly, to the point where they had an excess amount of food. Whoever had the rice had something everyone needed, so they became ‘king’.</p>
					<p>These turned into kingdoms and tribes, which then unified under a singular government, which was controlled entirely by the Emperor.</p>
					<p>This is the closest thing to colonization Japan has ever encountered, since they haven’t ever been entirely taken over by another entity.</p>
